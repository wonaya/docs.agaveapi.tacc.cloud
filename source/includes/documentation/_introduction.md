# Web API  

The Agave Science APIs power the Science-as-a-Service functionality of the Agave Platform. These web APIs allow you to manage all aspects of your code, collaborations, data, and your digital lab. 

The Science APIs follow basic REST concepts and use JSON to exchange data. Formal documentation of all endpoints is available in <a href="/swagger/">Swagger 1.2</a> and <a href="/swagger/agave.json">OpenAPI</a> formats. An <a href="/live-docs/">interactive API browser</a> is available as well.
